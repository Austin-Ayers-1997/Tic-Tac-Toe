# Austin's Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a python appication that runs from the command line
and allows a user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer.

## How to Use

You can use this application by downloading the source files and 
adding them to a directory. From the command line open that 
directory and use the command 

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py 0
```

to play the game against a computer who makes moves randomly. To
play against a computer that is intellent use the command

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py 1
```

## Definition of "Intelligence"
For this basic project, the "intelligence" is just a programmed way to check if the intelligence is going to lose and counter the player.

## Next Steps
Going to use the a library to create a gui representation of the game to allow a user to run the first command from command line and then playing the game in a graphical window.
